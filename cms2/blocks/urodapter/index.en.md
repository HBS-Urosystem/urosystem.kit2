      Traditionally, a catheter is used for instilling solutions into the
      urethra or bladder. However, this procedure is often painful especially if
      the treated condition itself causes pain in the related organs. Moreover,
      even if the catheterization is performed by an experienced professional,
      the catheter itself can cause microlesions in the bladder. Catheters
      themselves can often be the sources of infections. Both factors can result
      in complications.


      To overcome these issues, the UroDapter® has been developed. It can fully replace the catheter in the field of bladder instillation in both sexes. (It cannot be applied for draining liquid from the bladder.) It is to be attached directly onto the syringe. During the treatment, the UroDapter® penetrates the urethra merely 6–8mm deep, thus, it is only the instilled solution which reaches the bladder.
