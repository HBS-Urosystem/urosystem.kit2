      A potassium-free urine alkalizing pill which releases its active
      ingredients slowly and in a controlled form, thus, raising the urine pH
      and mitigates the pH fluctuation at the same time. The UretaCit was
      developed for IC/BPS patients, but it could be useful in the treatment of
      other conditions, too.


      A clinical pilot trial was conducted in 2020 to prove the safety and effectiveness of the UretaCit. The necessary preparations of mass production have been started at our partner, HGA Biomed. This Hungarian company, which is a part of the Vanessa Research Group (the US), has GMP certificate, too. 


      The UretaCit will be available on the market as food supplement in 2024.

      The optimized drug for the local treatment of IC/BPS. The UroVeSol
      contains the major, natural components of the GAG-layer of the bladder,
      just as well as local anesthetics. (The deficiencies of the GAG-layer are
      responsible for the symptoms of IC/BPS, in most cases.) In order to
      increase the effectiveness of the treatment, the UroVeSol is applied via
      “two-step instillation”.


      The UroVeSol is already available in Hungary, as a magistral product.


      The clinical trials of the UroVeSol will be started in 2022, the drug will be introduced to the market in 2024.

      IC/BPS patients of severe symptoms need regular bladder instillations.
      However, the availability of therapists is limited, which often results in
      under- or overtreatment. The UroStill was developed especially for female
      IC/BPS patients: this medical device provides them help so that they can
      perform the bladder instillation on their own, at their homes. The
      UroStill includes the UroDapter® syringe adapter, too. 


      The prototype of the device has been used in Hungary by more than 70 patients. The situation caused by the COVID pandemic proved how advantageous the home-treatment is. 


      The next version of the UroStill is under development, the device will be introduced to the international market in 2023.

      In most cases, the typical symptoms of IC/BPS are caused by the
      deficiencies of the GAG-layer, which covers the inner surface of the
      bladder. On the other hand, IC/BPS is not the only condition in which the
      GAG-layer can be damaged. There have been several attempts to estimate the
      status of this layer, but all the previous methods are invasive; some of
      them are painful and/or do not provide quantitative data.


      Not only is the GAG-Layer Integrity Test non-invasive and painless, but also it provides quantitative information, and it can be easily performed by any patient at their homes.


      The GAG-Layer Integrity Test is available for free on this webpage here: [Diagnostic help](/diagnostic-help). Also, in 2022 there will be a clinical trial launched to confirm its effectiveness.

      IC/BPS is a condition that needs a life-long treatment in most cases. It
      is essential for the patient and for his/her therapist to maintain close
      contact so that the treatment can be optimized. With our online patient
      follow-up system, the frequency of personal visits can be lowered, which
      makes the therapy cheaper and less time consuming.


      Patients can fill out the well-known IC/BPS questionnaires (O’Leary-Sant, Dorfman) online, they can upload the results of their GAG-Layer Integrity Tests and the system translates the data into graphs. Therefore, the therapist can easily decide whether the patient responds to the treatment, whether any changes or personal visits are necessary.


      The predecessor of this system has been used by Sándor Lovász for years. Currently, it is under development: Urosystem is planning to develop a system that can be used world-wide.
